  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>“I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that “an unjust law is no law at all.” -Martin Luther King Jr</p>

<p>Throughout history, a point of contention in the church has always been centered around one’s duty to obey the state. All throughout history, this has led to division among Church leaders. From early Christians obeying the Roman emperor to modern day pastors closing their churches at the wishes of government officials, one does not have to look very hard to see this division arise.</p>

<p>As Christians debate and discuss this topic, it is important to glean our wisdom and understanding from what the scriptures say on this issue since this is where Christians are supposed to derive their authority.</p>

<p>When looking at the scriptures at first, one might perceive a conflicting message with Ecclesiastes 8:2-4 expressly saying,</p>

<p>“Obey the king’s command, I say, because you took an oath before God. Do not be in a hurry to leave the king’s presence. Do not stand up for a bad cause, for he will do whatever he pleases. Since a king’s word is supreme, who can say to him, “What are you doing?”</p>

<p>This passage is incredibly direct. It leaves little room for dissent. If one only saw this passage, it could lead one to believe the role of a Christian is to be a clone of the state and government. If those verses were not clear enough on a Christians duty to the government, Solomon goes on,</p>

<p>“Whoever obeys his command will come to no harm, and the wise heart will know the proper time and procedure.”</p>

<p>It appears that the Biblical stance on obeying government authority is clearly on the side of obedience and allegiance to whatever governmental body holds power.</p>

<p>As Paul, a scholar of the Old Testament would later write in Romans 13, “Let everyone be subject to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. Consequently, whoever rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves”</p>

<p>While this may seem like a cut and dry case of blind submission and obedience to those in positions of power, the Bible has some conflicting stories to contest with these sections.</p>

<p>Take for example the characters of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the book of Daniel from the Old Testament. In Daniel 3, a story is told of three young Jews in exile in Babylon. King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon made a giant gold image of himself and proclaimed everyone must bow and worship it.</p>

<p>These three Jews, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, had the courage to not only defy their King but also the commands of Ecclesiastes 8. It would appear that by denying to worship Nebuchadnezzar they were defying God’s commands.</p>

<p>This would make sense as it was clearly written “Whoever obeys his (the king’s) command will come to no harm.” Yet when they were receiving punishment for refusing to bow and worship the king, the Lord directly interfered and saved them from the wrath of the king.</p>

<p>Surely he would not do such a thing for three young Jews receiving the fitting punishment for their actions. Surely those being punished for disobedience to God would not be delivered from their earthly consequences by God.</p>

<p>Let’s now look to the Hebrew Midwives in Egypt, commanded by Pharaoh to kill all Hebrew boys that they delivered. According to Solomon and Ecclesiastes, killing the little children would not be wrong since it was the order of the king. According to what he had written, it would be wrong for them to not kill the children and disobey the orders of Pharaoh.</p>

<p>That is unless what Solomon and later Paul was writing about was not blind undying allegiance to the government. Unless the relationship of a Christian to government were to be designed more as that of a child to a babysitter.</p>

<p>What do I mean by this? God makes it clear the rules by which he wants his children to be governed by. He lays a clear roadmap of morality and virtue that governments are to lead and rule by. It is clear that these basic principles of morality are supposed to be reflected in the governing laws of any government institution.</p>

<p>The commands of the Bible to be good citizens and obey the King particularly deal with commands outside of the clear dictates of the word of God. It is clear from the coming teaching of Christ that one must “give to Caesar what is Caesar’s”.</p>

<p>Simply put: any value or principle issued by the government not expressly enumerated against in the Bible must be obeyed.</p>

<p>It is through this principle that the Hebrew midwives were found righteous; Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego vindicated; and Paul writing Romans 13 from jail for disobedience to the government justified in his teaching.</p>

<p>The principle for governance laid out in the Bible is like that of instructions a mom might provide to a babysitter left in charge of her children. She gives rules, a few basic guidelines, but then she turns over her authority to the babysitter and commands her child to follow the babysitter’s additional rules.</p>

<p>If the babysitter then seeks to deliberately disobey the specific guidelines set forth by the mother, it is not only the right, but the duty of the child to obey the higher authority, his mother.</p>

<p>It is through this lens that Christians must see their relationship to government. It was an institution established by God for our benefit, but should that institution ever seek to deliberately coerce behavior antithetical to the values of the Bible, it is the duty of Christians to obey their higher authority.</p>

<p>It is through this that righteous children of God have been vindicated over the centuries. From Martin Luther sparking the reformation, Bonhoeffer seeking to kill the sole leader of Germany, Reverend Martin Luther King Jr writing from jail, and Corrie ten Boom lying to protect the Jews in her care. It is by remembering who ultimately has our allegiance and bestowed the governing bodies with their authority that Christians can maintain a healthy relationship with government.</p>
